API V4
Register
Register an app on the Digikey API portal: Digi-Key API V4. You will need the client ID and the client secret to use the API. You will also need a Digi-Key account to authenticate, using the Oauth2 process.

When registering an app the OAuth Callback needs to be set to https://localhost/digikey_callback.
